### Basic Developing Methond

Start developed status by:  
1. switch to `web` module path by `cd web`  
2. execute cmd `mvn spring-boot:run` to start the web container

The codes can be reloaded as already add the `spring-boot-devtools` as dependency

The spring devtools will detect the class path to check if there is any changes.
Can press Ctrl+F9(Build Project) to trigger the classpath changed if the reload doesn't take effect.
